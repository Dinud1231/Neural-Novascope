# üåç A World Away: Hunting for Exoplanets with AI

## üöÄ About the Project
Our project leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to automatically identify *exoplanets* from NASA‚Äôs open-source datasets.  
Traditionally, many exoplanets were discovered manually ‚Äî our model accelerates this process by detecting planetary patterns, classifying exoplanets, and estimating their habitability potential using AI.

This project is developed as part of the *NASA International Space Apps Challenge 2025* at *Caldwell University, New Jersey (USA)*.

## üåå Challenge
*A World Away: Hunting for Exoplanets with AI*

### Challenge Overview
Data from various space-based exoplanet survey missions have led to thousands of discoveries, but most of these exoplanets were identified manually.  
With advances in *AI and ML*, we aim to build a model trained on NASA's open exoplanet datasets to:
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Automatically analyze large data sets  
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Accurately identify exoplanets  
‚Ä¢‚Å†  ‚Å†Classify exoplanets by type and potential habitability

## üß† AI / Machine Learning Models

1.‚Å† ‚Å†*Nearest Neighbors (KNN)*  
   Finds exoplanets with similar physical characteristics for pattern analysis.

2.‚Å† ‚Å†*Classification Models (Random Forest / Logistic Regression)*  
   Classifies exoplanets into known categories (Neptunian, Super Earth, Gas Giant, Terrestrial).

3.‚Å† ‚Å†*Clustering Analysis (K-Means)*  
   Groups exoplanets based on their shared features to reveal hidden patterns.

4.‚Å† ‚Å†*LLM-Based Habitability Analysis (ChatGPT API)*  
   Uses Large Language Models to analyze planetary parameters (size, temperature, orbit)  
   and determine habitability potential in real time.

## üõ∞Ô∏è How It Works

1.‚Å† ‚Å†*Data Collection:*  
   We use NASA's Exoplanet Archive and preprocess datasets (removing noise, missing values).

2.‚Å† ‚Å†*Feature Engineering:*  
   Extract physical and orbital features (mass, radius, stellar flux, orbital period).

3.‚Å† ‚Å†*Model Training:*  
   Train ML algorithms (classification + clustering) to predict and categorize exoplanets.

4.‚Å† ‚Å†*Prediction & Visualization:*  
   Generate visual outputs and habitability scores for new exoplanet data.
